# Stock Comparison Tool

## Introduction
For this project, I observed statistics from 2017-2022 for three stocks and the overall S&P 500. The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance. The main goal is to set up a way to compare stocks' performance and give potential investors an idea as to the long-term profitability and volatility of stocks. While in this project, I selected three stocks to observe, this analysis can be used with any stock, as the stock ticker is all that is needed to pull information in this notebook.


## Analysis
I started by observing the graphs of the past five years for the stocks in question to give the user an idea of the stocks' recent trends.

It is worth noting that the date range can be adjusted, but I figured that five years would be an appropriate default setting, as it gives a large sample size but excludes old data that is less relevant.
