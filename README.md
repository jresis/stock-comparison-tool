# Stock Comparison Tool

## Introduction
For this project, I observed statistics from 2017-2022 for three stocks and the overall S&P 500. The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance. The main goal is to set up a way to compare stocks' performance and give potential investors an idea as to the long-term profitability and volatility of stocks. While in this project, I selected three stocks to observe, this analysis can be used with any stock, as the stock ticker is all that is needed to pull information in this notebook.


## Analysis
I started by observing the graphs of the past five years for the stocks in question to give the user an idea of the stocks' recent trends.
